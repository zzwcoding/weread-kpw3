# WeRead KOReader Plugin

## Project Overview

KOReader plugin for reading WeRead (微信读书) books and MP articles on e-ink devices. Lua codebase running inside KOReader's plugin system.

## Language

- Code, variable names, commit messages: English
- User-facing strings: wrapped in `_()` for i18n, Chinese translations in `weread/lib/i18n.lua`
- Communication with user: Simplified Chinese (简体中文)

## Key Conventions

### Module Namespace

- Keep every project-owned Lua module under the `weread/` namespace directory.
- Put non-UI modules in `weread/lib/` and load them with `require("weread.lib.<module>")`.
- Put UI and presentation modules in `weread/ui/` and load them with `require("weread.ui.<module>")`.
- Do not add project-owned modules under root-level `lib/` or `ui/`, and do not use bare `lib.*` or `ui.*` module keys. KOReader-owned imports such as `require("ui/widget/menu")` are not affected.
- Keep only KOReader plugin entry files such as `main.lua` and `_meta.lua` at the plugin root.

### KOReader Plugin API

- Plugin extends `WidgetContainer`, registered via `self.ui.menu:registerToMainMenu(self)`
- UI widgets: `Menu`, `InfoMessage`, `ConfirmBox`, `InputDialog`, `ButtonDialog`
- Event loop: `UIManager:show()`, `UIManager:close()`, `UIManager:scheduleIn()`
- Events: `onReaderReady` (book opened), `onCloseDocument` (book closed), `onFlushSettings`
- **`scheduleIn(0)` blocks the event loop** — use `scheduleIn(0.1)` minimum for cooperative multitasking
- Menu items support: `text`, `mandatory` (right-aligned), `post_text`, `callback`, `checked_func`, `enabled_func`, `sub_item_table_func`, `separator`, `keep_menu_open`
- Menu has built-in pagination (swipe, page indicators, search via page indicator tap)

### Settings Pattern

`settings/weread.lua` is reserved for small, bounded configuration and critical
state only. Never store downloaded content, annotations, thoughts, catalogs,
history, or other user-data collections there. Persist growing/queryable data
in dedicated SQLite databases under the plugin data directory instead, and
migrate legacy settings data before deleting its old key.

```lua
local val = self.settings:get("key")  -- reads with default from defaults table
self.settings:set("key", val)
self.settings:flush()                  -- must call to persist
```

### Network Pattern

```lua
self:runNetworkAction(label, function()
    -- runs inside NetworkMgr:runWhenOnline
    -- return string → shown as info; error → shown as error
end)
```

### Translation Pattern

```lua
local PluginUtil = require("weread.lib.plugin_util")
local _ = PluginUtil.tr
_("English key")                    -- simple
T(_("Template %1"), value)          -- with substitution (ffi/util.template)

-- In weread/lib/i18n.lua, add to zh table:
["English key"] = "中文翻译",
```

### Loop Variable

Use `_i` (not `_`) in `for _i, item in ipairs(...)` to avoid shadowing the `_()` translation function.

### Menu Maintenance

Whenever a menu item is added, removed, renamed, or moved:

- Update the menu definition in `weread/ui/menu.lua` (or the owning feature UI module)
- Add, rename, or remove the corresponding translation entry in `weread/lib/i18n.lua`; do not leave unused menu translation keys behind
- Keep the menu tree in `README.md` in sync
- Search all three files for the old and new labels before considering the change complete

## Two API Systems

1. **Gateway API** (official, `Bearer` auth with `api_key`): shelf, search, progress, book info
2. **Web API** (cookie auth): chapter content (`e_0`/`e_1`/`e_2`/`e_3`), reading time report, cookie renewal, MP articles

## WeRead API Integration Rules

**For any feature that calls WeRead APIs — especially undocumented/non-public Web APIs (anything NOT in the official gateway/skill):**

1. **Script-first validation**: Write a Python script in `scripts/` to prototype and validate the API interaction
2. **Verify on real data**: Run the script against actual WeRead responses to confirm correctness
3. **Then implement in Lua**: Only after the script validates successfully, implement the equivalent logic in the plugin

This applies to: content decoding, chapter downloading, image/resource packaging, reading time report payloads, cookie renewal, MP article fetching, and any new undocumented endpoint.

Existing reference scripts:
- `scripts/fetch_weread_epub.py` — content decoding + EPUB generation reference
- `scripts/verify_qr_login.py` — QR login, OTP, Cookie, user-info, API-key, and renewal-header verification
- `scripts/verify_mp_articles.py` — MP article API verification

Gateway (official skill) APIs can be called directly without script validation since they have stable, documented behavior.

## Privacy / Security

Never commit or log:
- KOReader `settings/weread.lua`
- Real API keys (`wrk-...`), cookie values (`wr_skey`, `wr_rt`, `wr_vid`, etc.)
- Anti-abuse headers (`x-wrpa-*`)
- Generated EPUB/cache files

Pre-commit scan:
```bash
rg -n "wrk-|wr_skey[=]|wr_rt[=]|wr_vid[=]|ptcz[=]|x-wrpa|thirdwx" -S .
```

## Release Workflow

When the user asks to publish a new version:

1. Pull the latest remote `main` with a fast-forward-only update and verify the worktree is clean.
2. Compare the latest release tag with `main`, then draft a concise, user-facing Chinese Changelog. Avoid implementation jargon and thank the relevant contributors.
3. Show the draft to the user and wait for explicit approval. Do not change version files, commit, push, tag, or publish before approval.
4. After approval, add the matching version section to `CHANGELOG.md` and update both `_meta.lua` and `main.lua` to the same version.
5. Run the repository's release checks: Lua specs, namespace checks, Luacheck, Python compilation, release-note extraction, package verification, and sensitive-information scanning.
6. Commit the release changes and push `main`. Do not create the release tag manually; let GitHub Actions create the tag and GitHub Release.
7. Wait for normal CI, the pinned KOReader integration test, and the Release workflow. Verify the tag, release URL, package, and checksum before reporting success.
8. Generate a vertical release poster in the established warm ivory, forest-green, minimalist editorial style. Give the main feature the strongest visual emphasis and summarize other improvements in smaller cards. Keep contributor acknowledgements in the Changelog unless the user asks to place them on the poster.

## Unimplemented Features (WIP)

These are placeholder menu items shown when a WeRead book is open, currently greyed out:
- Book details — current-book WeRead metadata display
- Notes — read-only WeRead highlights/thoughts

## Reference Docs

- `docs/weread-api-reference.md` — full API endpoint reference (gateway + Web)
- `docs/weread-content-research.md` — content decoding and image packaging research
- `docs/weread-annotations-flow.md` — underline/thought download → embed → tap-to-display flow
- `docs/weread-progress-sync-plan.md` — progress protocol research, mapping, and safety design
